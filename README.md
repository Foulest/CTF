# MinigameFramework

## General Info

This framework was built with the purpose of making arena based minigames such as woolwars, sumo, skywars etc. However,
with minimal addition of an arena loader and other interfaces it can likely be adapted to work with any minigame.

## Architecture

All minigame state is contained within or linked to an instance
of [Game](core/src/main/java/com/readutf/inari/core/game/Game.java).
Each Game instance must have an [ActiveArena](core/src/main/java/com/readutf/inari/core/arena/ActiveArena.java) tied to
the game at all times as many different modules are tied into this (e.g Spectators)

## Game

A game is created using the builder pattern, and is provided the arena, event manager, and the teams fighting in the
match.

*The following code snippet is taken from the Development
module* [SumoGameStarter:](development/src/main/java/com/readutf/inari/test/games/sumo/SumoGameStarter.java)

```java
Game game = Game.builder(InariDemo.getInstance(), load, eventManager, teams,
                (game1, previousRound) -> new SumoRound(game1, (SumoRound) previousRound),
                (game1, previousRound) -> new SumoRound(game1, (SumoRound) previousRound),
                (game1, previousRound) -> new SumoRound(game1, (SumoRound) previousRound),
                (game1, previousRound) -> new SumoRound(game1, (SumoRound) previousRound),
                (game1, previousRound) -> new SumoRound(game1, (SumoRound) previousRound))
        .setPlayerSpawnHandler(new TeamBasedSpawning("spawn"))
        .setSpectatorSpawnHandler(new SumoSpectatorSpawnFinder())
        .build();
```

### Rounds

The flow of the gamemode is tied directly to your use of Rounds. A round can signify a literal round within the minigame
or be used to manage state and flow. Within the Development module, specifically the sumo minigame,
you can see how Rounds can be used to manage the pre-game, fighting, and post game states.
